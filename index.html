    They said to write about myself. I dont even know where to begin. This my 3rd attepmt in html, Hope it works out this time. I taking my cource from App Brewry. The teacher is quite good. I kinda should thank Khushnuma for it but eh. Oh! I have
    three cats. Are you a cat person or a dog person? I am both actually. I dont know if they have any term for that. I am just filling up the spaces. Dont mind me. Today is 23rd Spetember 2020. I hope you are doing well. I will graduate next year
    btw. Wish me luck. Maybe these cources will help. Maybe it wont. Either way I dont hope to survive. I really wished the world ended with this pandamic but somehow I survived. Heading down a dark tunnel with no light in front. Thats all.
